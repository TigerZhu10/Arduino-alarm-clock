# Project Guide: Ardiuno-alarm-clock

## Genaral Description:

### This is a Arduino Alarm Clock project. This project is best for beginners to learn and study it. The main thing you are get it learn from the projects includes:
- How to use array and For loop
- How to use Millis
- How to create State Machine
- How to connect the circuit using breadboard
### This Clock's functions includes:
- setting the realtime
- display real time
- setting alarm time
- make buzzer sound when it is on time
## How To Learn And Where To Learn:
### This project's infrommation is wide and well-known. So the website you can learn from includes:
- youtube
- Arduino official website
- Github 
- Hackster.io
- Adafruit Learning System

## Start Project:
### If you want to make yourself an alarm clock by your own then you'll need:
- Arduino Uno x 1
- 5641as 4 x 7 Segment module x 1
- push button x 1
- active buzzer x 1
- 220ohm resistor x 4
- bread board x 1
- jumper wires
